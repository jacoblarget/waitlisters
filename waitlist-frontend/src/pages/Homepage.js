                                    Introducing FIFO, the cutting-edge web
                                    platform that enables students to join a
                                    virtual queue for office hours and helps
                                    instructors manage their queues efficiently.
                                    No more waiting in physical lines outside a
                                    professor's office or wasting valuable time.
                                    With FIFO, students can digitally join the
                                    queue from anywhere, anytime. They can view
                                    their position in the queue, receive
                                    estimated wait times, and get notified when
                                    it's their turn to meet with the instructor.
                                    Instructors can manage the queue seamlessly
                                    through an intuitive dashboard that displays
                                    real-time queue status, student information,
                                    wait times, and more. They can prioritize
                                    urgent requests, send notifications to
                                    students, and effectively manage their
                                    office hours. Additionally, instructors can
                                    gather queue metrics and valuable insights
                                    that can inform their teaching practices.
                                    FIFO is a user-friendly and efficient
                                    platform that simplifies the
                                    student-instructor interaction and
                                    streamlines office hours for both parties.
                                    Say goodbye to physical queues and hello to
                                    a seamless office hour experience with FIFO.
